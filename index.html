an answers, 
everything fascinated me with curiousity<br>
 and the eager to learn about certain things, 
Interested of what logic and challenges behind every programs, games, and websites,
<br>How they could make it easier to use for each individuals.
I choose IT out of curiosity for each
unlimited learnings,
 <br>for challenges I wanted to face. for everyday logics,
and for those tiring days, i wanted to experience those things,<br>
 to challenge 
myself to go beyond my limition, to create and to experience, to enjoy, for 
each learning i'll be facing will be worth a tons.<br>
 Because of this curiousity i was
eager to understand, to achieve the things I wanted in life.
To have and to know each answers, <br>
    <br>
<br>
The feelings I have towards this course 
was something interesting. I wanted to be able to comprehend each challenge and logic behind 
every programs,<br>

 This helps me to find the things
I wanted in life
and in each generations technology
will becoming more advance,<br>
so as its program. I wanted to take this oppurtinity
to learn its system and to create.<br>
